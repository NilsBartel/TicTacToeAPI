-- how does it start?
give whole matchHistory and let the frontend decide if there is a running match?
or have the backend give a running or new match

DATABASE:
DBUser -> make the into one method and just create a user Object



Match
 -> POST move
 -> new game
 -> select difficulty
 -> matchHistory
 -> analyse
 -> score?
 -> quit/logout

 error message as json
 - controller class
 - dont need a response class if i get a match and respond a match

->



Login

 -> POST  password reset
 -> POST  create account



service classes are classes that are used once but are in another class to be less crowded
