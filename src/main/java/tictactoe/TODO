- MatchHistory
- Analyze
- create a token error

- check account creation again






-- how does it start?
give whole matchHistory and let the frontend decide if there is a running match?
or have the backend give a running or new match

DATABASE:
DBUser -> make the into one method and just create a user Object

- difficulty: just always take it from the match (match.getDifficulty)





1. GET match -> takes token -> gives running or new match  (take userID from token)
2. POST match -> takes token and match -> returns match with computer move
3. ...?
4. profit






 ->
 -- a class that constructs the whole response (message + header (rCode) and so on)
->



Login
 -> POST  login
 -> POST  password reset
 -> POST  create account



service classes are classes that are used once but are in another class to be less crowded
